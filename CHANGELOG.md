## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Expo Widgets Patch Application**: Fixed `@bittingz/expo-widgets` Logger conflict patch not being applied in monorepo setup
  - Root cause: `patch-package` was only configured in `apps/app/` but dependencies are hoisted to root `node_modules/`
  - Added `patch-package` to root `devDependencies` and `postinstall` script to root `package.json`
  - Patches in `/patches/` directory now apply correctly during `yarn install` at root level
  - Fixes iOS build error: `missing argument for parameter 'logHandlers' in call`

### Fixed - App Store Compliance
- **iOS Privacy Manifest**: Added proper data collection declarations
  - Declares `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeProductInteraction` for PostHog analytics
  - Declares `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeCrashData` for Sentry error tracking
  - Both marked as not linked to user and not used for tracking

- **Android Permissions**: Removed `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` from production builds
  - Permission now debug-only (for React Native dev overlay)
  - Already properly isolated in `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`
