- **Nested Discovery**: Explicit instructions for agents to discover localized `AGENTS.md` files in `apps/app`, `landing_page`, and `mintlify_docs`.
- **Claude Integration**: Updated `CLAUDE.md` with `@AGENTS.md` import syntax for Claude Code compatibility.

### Changed
- **Marketing**: Rebranded all "vibe folder" mentions to "AGENTS.md Standard" on the landing page and throughout the documentation.

## [1.0.0-rc1] - 2025-12-26

New update with many improvements and reliability fixes. It's recommended to use this new version of the boilerplate for future developments or pull these changes in if you've recently started!

### Added
- **Authentication**: Refactored `useAuth` to support the **PKCE flow** for OAuth logins.
- **In-App Social Login**: Integrated `expo-web-browser` for a seamless social login experience.
- **Diagnostics**: Smarter network error messages that suggest checking project status in the Supabase dashboard.
- **Styling**: Introduced a comprehensive Neutral/Slate palette across the entire design system.

### Changed
- **Navigation**: Finalized deep linking configuration in `App.tsx` for all core screens and tab routes.
- **Mock Mode**: Updated mock authentication to support code-to-session exchange simulation.

### Fixed
- **Subscriptions**: Implemented auto-reset and sync for `subscriptionStore` on auth state changes.
