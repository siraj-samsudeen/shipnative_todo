> **⚠️ CRITICAL**: [AI_CONTEXT.md](./AI_CONTEXT.md) is the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for this project.

## Agent Instructions
This project uses the `AGENTS.md` standard for AI context management. Please refer to:
- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) - Root instructions and setup.
- [AI_CONTEXT.md](./AI_CONTEXT.md) - Tech stack and coding patterns.

If working in a subfolder, please check for a local `AGENTS.md` file (e.g., `apps/app/AGENTS.md`).
